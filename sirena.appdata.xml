    <p>
      Sirena is a fast and minimalist audio player for Linux. It groups
      tracks by album, which uses less space and simplifies rearranging
      your playlist. Sirena does not organize your tracks in a music
      library and does not stream or download tracks. Therefore, it is
      best suited for people who store their tracks by album and want a
      simple way of playing them. Sirena allows you to quickly search for
      music on local drives and in the playlist. It also features an
      equalizer and displays covers and desktop notifications.
