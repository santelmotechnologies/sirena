Description: Sirena is a fast and minimalist audio player for Linux. It
 groups tracks by album, which uses less space and simplifies
 rearranging your playlist. Sirena does not organize your tracks in a
 music library and does not stream or download tracks. Therefore, it is
 best suited for people who store their tracks by album and want a
 simple way of playing them. Sirena allows you to quickly search for music
 on local drives and in the playlist. It also features an equalizer and
 displays covers and desktop notifications. Sirena is a fork of
 Pogo. Pogo is a fork of Decibel
 Audio Player and supports most common audio formats. It is written in
 Python and uses GTK+ and GStreamer.
