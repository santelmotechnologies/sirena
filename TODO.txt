=== Roadmap ===

O Don't skip to next track early (currently 2 seconds before end).
O Search whole system by default (after "locate" finishes).
O Add application-wide message system for warnings. Should use event system.
O Show warning if search commands fail.


=== Features that will MAYBE be implemented ===

O Stop after current album / track (Playlist context menu entry)
O Party View (Fullscreen)


=== Features that will NOT be implemented ===

- Do not add empty dirs to Tracktree (Irritating)
- Ellipsize names (Looks odd)
- Play audio CDs (Rip and play is nicer anyways)
- Use multiprocessing for searching (Too error prone)
- Crossfading (too tedious in gstreamer)
- Lyrics (KISS)
- Scrobbling Support (KISS)
- Shuffle
- Repeat
- Playlist loading
- Sound Indicator for Ubuntu SoundMenu (unity is discontinued)
- Enqueue (KISS)
